# Gemini Memories

This file contains guidelines and conventions to follow for this project.

## General

-   **License Header**: All new files must include the following license header, with the comment style adapted to the file extension:

## Bash

-   **Expressive Output**: Use `echo` commands with emojis to provide clear and expressive output in all shell/bash scripts.
-   **Input Validation**: Always include input validation in shell/bash scripts to check for empty variables and other necessary conditions.
-   **Variable Naming**: Use `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` for environment variables in shell scripts for consistency.
-   **Cross-Platform `sed`**: When using `sed`, detect the user's operating system and use the appropriate syntax for in-place editing (e.g., `sed -i ''` for macOS and `sed -i` for Linux).
-   **Environment Setup**: When adding new environment variables to `env.sh`, also add a corresponding `echo` statement to print the variable's value when the script is sourced. This helps with debugging.
-   **gcloud Project**: When creating an `env.sh` file, include `gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID` at the end to ensure the correct project is configured.

## Python

-   **Production Server**: When deploying Python web applications, use a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., `gunicorn`) instead of the built-in development server.
-   **Development Server Logic**: Remove the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block from your main application file (`app.py`) to prevent the development server from starting in production.

## Deployment

-   **GCloud Authentication**: Force gcloud re-authentication at the beginning of deployment scripts to ensure security, using `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`.
-   **Procfile**: For Cloud Run deployments, create a `Procfile` to declare the command to start the application. For example:
    ```
    web: gunicorn --bind :$PORT --workers 1 --threads 8 app:app
    ```
-   **Deployment Script**: In deployment scripts (e.g., `deploy.sh`), ensure the `gcloud run deploy` command is executed from the application's source code directory. Use `cd "$(dirname "$0")"` to navigate to the script's directory.
